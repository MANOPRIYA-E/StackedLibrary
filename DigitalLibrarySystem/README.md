# Digital Library System 📚

A simple Java project demonstrating **OOP’s 4 Pillars** + **DSA**.

## 🚀 Features
- Encapsulation → Private fields with getters/setters in `Book.java`
- Inheritance → `Student` and `Teacher` extend `User`
- Polymorphism → `borrow()` method overridden in `Student` & `Teacher`
- Abstraction → `User` provides a common blueprint
- DSA → `ArrayList` (for dynamic storage) & `HashMap` (for fast lookup)
